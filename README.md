# Logistic_regression_rain_forecast

## Learnings

- Constructing a **multifeature logistic regression** model from scratch including:
    - Feature scaling
    - One-hot encoding
- Splitting data into training, evaluation and test set based on time period
- Evaluation dataset is used in iterative process but test data is final benchmark of the model
- Imputing values when there is missing data
- Validate if model is predicting better than random-guess or all-same model

## Dependencies

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install scikit-learn pandas plotly matplotlib seaborn numpy
```
